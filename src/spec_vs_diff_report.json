  "summary": "Most core UI pieces are implemented (header/nav with dynamic cart count, hero, trending books grid with 4 specified titles/authors and cover images, cart drawer with quantity controls/removal, and a warm Tailwind theme). However, several requirements that demand exact text/structure and required static image assets are not fully evidenced in the diff, and there are multiple unrequested additions (Internet Identity/actor hooks, React Query wiring, backend stub, and extra footer/checkout content).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Header matches the provided HTML structure including logo text exactly “Chapter One 📚”.",

      "reason": "Hero text is present but there is no evidence it matches the (unseen) provided HTML exactly; the diff shows specific strings that may differ (e.g., “Find Your Next Great Escape”, “From timeless classics to modern thrillers, we have it all.”, “Browse Collection”).",

      "requirement": "Footer displays exactly: “© 2024 Chapter One Bookstore. All rights reserved.”",
      "reason": "Footer uses a dynamic year via `new Date().getFullYear()` instead of the fixed “2024”, and includes additional attribution text/links not part of the required footer text.",
